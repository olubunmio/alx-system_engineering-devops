# Features from Task 0 (Please Check below for Task 1 and 2)

- A Server
A server is a computer that provides services for other computers (clients) over a
network.
It is usually located in a data center.
It can be physical or virtual.
All servers actually run an operating system (OS)

- Web Server
A web server on the other hand is a software whose role is to serve webpages (which
contain static contents) to other computers (clients) over a network.

- Application Server
Application server is different from web server in the sense that it computes dynamic
content (unlike web server which serves static content) and passes the dynamic content
to a web server which makes the content available to the client.

- Database
The role of the database in the above diagram is to reliably store the application data.

- Domain Name System (DNS)
The DNS is responsible for translating the record of a domain name into IP addresses.
In the diagram www.foobar.com is an A record because it resolves to an IP address.


- OTHER NOTES
1. In the above diagram, the server is an SPOF (Single point of failure) because
nothing is redundant in the set-up.
2. As a result of this nature of setup, the website would be temporarily down when new
code is deployed and the web server neets to be restarted.
3. This infrastructure will not be able to handle traffic that would exceed the server
capacity.
4. The network protocol currently used in the overall setup is the TCP/IP suite.




# -------------------------------> Task 1

- LOAD BALANCER
The load balancer is configured to have an active-passive set-up. Therefore, the load
balancer now will distribute traffic to the failover server in case if the first
server is down.
A point to note with the above ilustration is that the load balancer is still a single
point of failure (SPOF).

- MySQL
As illustrated in the diagram provided by the link above, MySQL used replication to
keep its data synchronized. The master database can accept read/write operations while
the replica can only accept reads.



# -----------------------------> Task 2

# Firewall
- It filters the network traffic going into a machine and out from the machine.

# HTTPS ensures that the traffic is encrypted and cannot be read/understood by a middle-man in-between the server/client connection.

# Monitoring
It is used to monitor and check if something is broken/slow.
